Tool to crop the figure in a pdf page generated by a powerpoint (or equivalent) tool.

Usage is simple, export pptx to pdf, then:

```bash
bash figures_process.sh FILE PAGEID FIG_NAME PAGEID2 FIG_NAME ... 
```

Where `FILE` is the pdf file name (without the extention .pdf!), and PAGEID* are the page numbers where you want to crop a figure, and FIG_NAME* the associated name to give to the figure.


This tool is a slightly modified version initialized coded by [Thomas Robert](https://www.thomas-robert.fr/).
